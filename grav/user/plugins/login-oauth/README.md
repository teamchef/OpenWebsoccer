# Grav Login Plugin OAuth Add-On

The **Grav Login Plugin OAuth Add-On** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) adds the ability for users to log in using Social sites.

Currently Available Providers:
- Facebook
- Github
- Google
- Twitter

# Installation

The **login-oauth** plugin actually requires the help of the **login** plugin.

Both are available via GPM, and because the plugin has dependencies you just need to proceed and install the login-oauth plugin, and agree when prompted to install the others:

```
$ bin/gpm install login-oauth
```

# Usage

Add a login-protected page, then make sure you fill the "Route" in the Login plugin settings. Add this route to the callback url required by the OAuth application on the service desired. Example: `http://yoursite.com/login`.

>Note: OAuth has not been tested with Grav's multilang feature! Due to this, certain OAuth providers may not function properly on multilang sites

>IMPORTANT: `localhost` may NOT be used for callback and allowed URLs when creating OAuth provider applications due to certificate verification issues. Some services allow other URLs and it may be possible to add custom domains pointing to 127.0.0.1 in your hosts file and point applications there. GitHub and Twitter are tested to work on localhost too, if it does not work you can use a tunnel like ngrok to test locally
